# Autonomous Vehicle Driving Project

## Description

This repository contains the code for the final project of the Autonomous Vehicle Driving course of the Computer Engineering Master's Degree @ Universit√† degli Studi di Salerno.

The project has been developed and tested using CARLA Simulator.

The assignment consisted in integrating an autonomous driving codebase provided during the course with two functionalities:

- vehicle and pedestrian avoidance;
- traffic light recognition and management (stop at red light, keep going/start at green or yellow light).

The latter functionality was implemented using the CARLA traffic light detector available at [this](https://github.com/affinis-lab/traffic-light-detection-module) repository.

## Demonstration

This is a brief gif showing our system in action. The video is sped-up because the simulation framerate was quite low while recording.
